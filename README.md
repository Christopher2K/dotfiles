# My dotsfiles & stuffs

This repository (now managed by chezMoi) contains my dotfiles and stuff I'd like to keep between my machines. Everything should work as expected on macOS.

## Requirements

### Few important tools

- Dependency manager: [brew](https://brew.sh/)
- Shell: [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- Window manager: [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)
- Widget manager: [Ãœbersicht](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht)
- Editor: Neovim v0.9+
- Terminal: [Kitty Terminal](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)

### How to use

You can technically pick any file here and use it as a config file for the corresponding tool. If you want to get the full installation

### Interpreter version manager

I'm using ASDF to get:

- Python
- Node and PNPM
- Rust
- Ruby
- Go
- Neovim
  ....
